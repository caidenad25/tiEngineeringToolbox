### Installation
To install the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

- Download the desired file from **Releases** (older) or **bin** (current)
- Download and install TI-Connect CE
- Plug your calculator into the same machine as TI-Connect CE
- Open TI-Connect CE and navigate to the Program Editor workspace
- Click "Open Program"
- Select the program.8xp file you downloaded in step 1
- Select the "Send" icon in the toolbar to send the program to your calculator

### Usage
To use the programs, follow these steps:

- Unplug your calculator once the program is installed
- Click the "PRGM" button on your calculator
- Select the new program using the arrows or the number listed

### Programs
The programs included are self-explanatory as to what they are capable of calculating. For obvious reasons, no 3D graphing can occur on the TI-84 Plus CE as this is not within the model's specifications.

- **Master** - contains a variety of capabilities and elementary formulas
- **Convert** - allows conversion of units
- **Unit Circle** - displays an interactive unit circle with values
- **Statics** - calculates values for statics, aimed for 3D usage
- **Physics** - calculates kinematics and other elementary physics principles
- **Econ** - performs elementary and specific economics calculations
- **Stats** - assists the calculation of statistical values, specific to elementary usage
- **Cleaner** - cleans most variables (not dependencies for these) stored in RAM
